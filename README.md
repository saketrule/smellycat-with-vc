# SmellyCat

SmellyCat is a simple tool that detects smells in your classes.
The tool is based on Maur√≠cio Aniche's PhD thesis. 

Currently, we only support two architectures: Spring MVC and Android.
In Spring MVC, we evaluate the quality of your `Controllers`, 
`Services`, `Components`,`Repositories`, and `Entities`.
In Android, we evaluate the quality of your `Activity`, `Task`,
and `Fragment`.

Examples of the analysis: [CK in SSP (Spring MVC)](http://mauricioaniche.github.io/smellycat/ssp.html),
[CK in AnyMemo (Android)](http://mauricioaniche.github.io/smellycat/anymemo.html).


# How to interpret?

SmellyCat produces a treemap. It means that the higher the class' square,
the higher the metric value. However, it classifies the value in 4
categories. Green means that your class is below any risk limit. It means
that, to the point of view of that metric, you should not be worried.
Yellow means moderate risk. It means that you should start taking
care of it. Light red means high risk, and dark red means
very high risk. These are the classes you should be worried about, as
they are very far from what we consider "good".

You can see the specific thresholds values in our paper.

## CK metrics

SmellyCat analyses CK metrics in your architectural roles and
uses Alves' et al approach to find moderate, high, and very high
risk classes. 

We use the following metrics:

- **Weighted Methods Per Class (WMC)**. In a simple way,
it is the sum of each method's complexity in a class. It is usually represented
by the Number of McCabe, which is the number of different possible paths of execution in a method. 

- **Number of Methods (NOM)**. The number of methods in a class
is also another common metric to explain the complexity of a class. Some tools
even use NOM instead of McCabe's Number to represent WMC. 

- **Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO)**. The number of 
classes a class depends upon. It counts classes used from both external
libraries as well as classes from the project.

- **Response for a Class (RFC)**. It is the count of 
all method invocations that happen in a class. 

- **Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)**. As the name suggests,
it measures the lack of cohesion in a class. The idea behind the metric is to count
the number of intersections between methods and attributes. The higher
the number, the less cohesive is the class.
